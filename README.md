🗳️ MLA Public Grievance & Information App

This is a full-featured mobile application built using Flutter, designed to improve civic engagement by acting as a direct communication channel between the citizens and their local MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly). The app allows users to submit grievances, access important government-related information, and stay updated with the latest programs and development work being carried out in their area.

The goal of this app is to enhance transparency, accountability, and citizen participation by empowering users to voice their concerns and receive timely resolutions from the MLA’s team.

📱 About the App

In many regions, citizens face challenges in reaching out to government authorities to raise complaints or seek support. This app solves that problem by acting as a centralized platform where users can:

✔️ Submit issues or concerns directly to the MLA’s office
✔️ Track upcoming programs and developments in their area
✔️ Learn about women empowerment initiatives
✔️ Access important helpline numbers in case of emergencies
✔️ View the MLA’s profile and contact details
✔️ Manage their own user profile

The app is tailored for local use, possibly even in a specific constituency, and can be customized for use by other political representatives or governance bodies.
